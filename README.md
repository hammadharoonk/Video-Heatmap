# Video-Heatmap

Creating videos of aesthetic heat maps from videos of urban scenes, showing the optical flow patterns people and cars manifest, using Python and OpenCV.

This is a study into optical flow patterns formed by the movement of large crowds of pedestrians and vehicles on a busy intersection, using OpenCV's inbuilt MOG2 Background subtraction. Some very interesting patterns are formed, which can show desire paths, driver habits, and pedestrian flows in the absence of adequate street infrastructure; which can help guide further street design.

Further exploration could identify different types of objects, and create separate flows for each object. Most existing image-detection models are pre-trained on frontal images so a custom model trained top-view images would be required. would appreciate any feedback or recommendations!

Inspired by Intel Heatmap which outputs an image frame: https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/python-cv-samples/blob/master/examples/motion-heatmap/motion-heatmap.py
My version shows the traces in real-time video, and contains adjustable trace length with a rolling First In First Out stack.
